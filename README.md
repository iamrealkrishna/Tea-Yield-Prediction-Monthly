# Tea-Yield-Prediction-Monthly

This project aims to use several prominent machine learning algorithms such as Support
Vector Machines, Support Vector Regression, Multi Layer Percepton, and K-Nearest Neighbours
to quantify and evaluate the variation expressed in several climatic variables, and further
assess the yield-response to this variation, of an economically noteworthy cash crop - Tea. The
application of Machine Learning has enabled hitherto unprecedented breakthroughs in exposing
underlying relationships between factors in numerous data-intensive fields such as image recognition
and computer vision, natural language processing and control automation [3]. Having
said that, the implementation of Machine Learning for weather and yield prediction remains
a relatively recent endeavour, with traditional process-based cropping models and statistical
models dominating studies until mid 2010s [
